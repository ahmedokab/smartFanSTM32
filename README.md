##  Overview
This project implements a **closed-loop smart fan system** using an STM32 microcontroller.  
The fanâ€™s speed is automatically adjusted based on temperature readings, with live telemetry sent to a PC terminal ( I used PuTTY personally ).

The project demonstrates integration of multiple STM32 peripherals:
- **PWM** for fan motor speed control  
- **ADC** to read a temperature sensor (NTC thermistor)  
- **UART** to stream telemetry data to a serial terminal  
-  **IÂ²C** with BME280 sensor and **SPI/IÂ²C OLED display** for on-device visualization
-  In the end, I switched to the I2C option for greater accuracy, but the  code provides an option for both via an if statement

##  Features
- Reads temperature in real time using an **NTC thermistor** voltage divider  
- Uses a **feedback loop** to adjust fan PWM duty cycle according to temperature  
- Streams temperature and fan speed data to **PuTTY / Arduino Serial Monitor** at 115200 baud  
- Tested with **9V motor + N-MOSFET driver circuit** sf
- Modular design allows swapping the thermistor for a **BME280 digital sensor** over IÂ²C

##  Hardware Used
- STM32 Nucleo F411RE
- NTC Thermistor (10kÎ©, Vishay NTCLE100E3) + 10kÎ© resistor voltage divider  
- MOSFET (FQP30N06L) for fan driver (logic-level N-channel)  
- DC Fan 12V) powered from external adapter or battery  
- BME280 for digital temp/humidity/pressure over IÂ²C  
- SSD1306 OLED for real-time display via SPI/IÂ²C  
- Breadboard + jumper wires + a bunch of resistors
- USB cable for STM32 programming and UART telemetry  

## Software
- **IDE**: STM32CubeIDE  
- **Drivers**: STM32 HAL (generated via CubeMX)  
- **Language**: C  
- **UART Terminal**: PuTTY / Arduino Serial Monitor (115200 baud, 8N1)

Results over PuTTY when in NTC mode:

Used 84Mhz frequency, period = 1000. So when the duty is stated to be 500, it means a 50% duty cycle as consistent with my STM32 IDE setup.
